Leetcode to be performed regularly

Interviewers see these 3 cases:

1. Best - Fastest
2. Average
3. Worst - Slowest

Asymptotic notations

1. Big O - Worst case - upper bound, takes max time
2. Omega - Best case - lower bound, takes min time
3. Theta - Average case - right bound

Array: 

length/size = zero to (size - 1)

index or subscript

index starts with 0 whereas location starts with 1.
